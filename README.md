# Premium Leap Year Calendar

A stunning, responsive Leap Year Calendar built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## How to Upload to GitHub Correctly

If you are seeing only HTML without styling or functionality, please ensure you have uploaded **ALL** these files to your repository:

1.  `index.html` (The main structure)
2.  `style.css` (The styling and design)
3.  `script.js` (The calendar logic)

### Steps to Fix Visibility:

1.  **Check Files**: Open your GitHub repository and make sure `style.css` and `script.js` are present in the same folder as `index.html`.
2.  **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure the filenames are exactly `style.css` and `script.js` (all lowercase).
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    - Under **Branch**, select `main` (or your default branch) and the `/ (root)` folder.
    - Click **Save**.
    - Wait about 1-2 minutes, then refresh your site URL.
